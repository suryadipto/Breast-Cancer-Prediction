 # Aim of the project

- To build a breast cancer prediction system from morphological data pertaining to cancerous and non-cancerous tumors in the breast.
- Build different types of classification models:

- K-nearest neighbor (KNN)
- Decision tree
- Support vector machine
- Logistic regression
- Artificial neural networks

- Give the students an intuition about the different types of models, and how to choose ML frameworks based on the dataset and the task at hand.
- Give the students an overview of deep learning

### Programming language of instruction (Matlab)

- Ease of use, especially for beginners
- In-built one-line code to implement ML models
- Vectorizable code
- Anyone who doesn&#39;t have a subscription of Matlab is encouraged to install _ **Octave** _. All of the commands that we shall use on Matlab can also be ran on Octave. Octave is a great free substitute for Matlab.
